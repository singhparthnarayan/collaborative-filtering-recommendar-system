# collaborative-filtering-recommendar-system


Recommender systems are tools for interacting with large and complex information spaces. They provide a personalized view
of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many e-commerce and social media applications such as Amazon, Netflix, Pandora, Spotify, Google and Facebook.

In this project we provide an example of a movie recommender system with collaborative filtering technique.

We illustrated how to build a model based collaborative filtering recommender system on Python.

Implemented Stochastic Gradient Descent for minimizing the cost function.

Used the model to make recommendations for the user.
